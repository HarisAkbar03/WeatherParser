# Weather Data Analyzer

## Overview

The **Weather Data Analyzer** is a desktop application developed in **Java** using **JavaFX** to analyze and display weather data from a CSV file. The application reads weather data, processes it to generate statistics such as the average temperature and number of rainy days, and displays the results in an interactive, visually appealing GUI. 

This project provides a simple yet effective tool for visualizing weather data and offers users an easy way to analyze weather patterns.

## Features

- **CSV File Parsing**: Reads weather data from a CSV file.
- **Weather Statistics**: Calculates the average temperature and counts the number of rainy days.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Displays the weather report with a background image and neatly styled text.
- **User Interactivity**: Allows users to analyze weather data at the click of a button.
- **Modern UI Design**: Utilizes JavaFX for smooth and responsive design with image background and customized buttons.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on any platform where Java and JavaFX are supported.

## Technologies Used

- **Java (JDK 15 or later)**: The core language for the application.
- **JavaFX**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **FXML & CSS**: For defining the UI layout and styling.
- **CSV File Parsing**: To read and process weather data stored in CSV format.
- **Lambda Expressions**: For efficient data manipulation and filtering.
- **Maven (Optional)**: For project dependency management and building.
